## Overview
My research focuses on developing **machine learning methods that are interpretable, robust, 
and usable in practice**, particularly in settings where human expertise plays a critical role.

I am especially interested in scenarios where automated systems must support, rather than replace, 
human decision-making.

## Core themes

### Interpretable anomaly detection
Designing models that can detect anomalies in complex data streams while providing 
human-understandable explanations for their decisions.

### Human-in-the-loop learning
Developing learning paradigms that integrate expert feedback to improve model performance, 
trust, and adaptability over time.

### Temporal and graph-based data analysis
Methods for learning from structured and time-dependent data, including industrial sensor data 
and networked systems.

## Collaboration
I actively collaborate with researchers and practitioners across academia and industry, 
particularly in applied machine learning and data-driven decision support.
