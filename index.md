## About
I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Department of Technology, Uppsala University. 
My research lies at the intersection of **machine learning**, **data mining**, and **human-centered AI**, 
with a particular focus on **interpretable anomaly detection**, **human-in-the-loop learning**, 
and **time-series and graph-based analysis**.

A recurring theme in my work is addressing **societally motivated problems** that arise in 
large-scale, complex systems, often in close collaboration with **domain experts** and 
industrial partners.
